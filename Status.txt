    SECURE PASSWORD VAULT - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
========================================================

WHAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED:

1. HashMap (include/auth.hpp)
   - Fast lookup for storing users and session tokens in memory
   - Handles collisions using separate chaining

2. Crypto Module (src/crypto.cpp)
   - AES-256 encryption to protect passwords
   - PBKDF2 password hashing with salt
   - Random generation for salts and IVs

3. AuthManager (src/auth.cpp)
   - User registration and login
   - Session management with tokens
   - File persistence for user data

4. B-Tree (src/btree.cpp)
   - Disk-based storage for password vault entries
   - Efficient search by site name and user ID

5. StorageManager (src/storage.cpp)
   - Integration of all modules
   - Add/retrieve/update/delete password entries
   - Multi-user data isolation

HOW TO RUN/TEST:

Step 1: Open PowerShell in project folder

Step 2: Build the project
   cd build
   cmake --build . --target TestDataStructures

Step 3: Run the tests
   .\TestDataStructures.exe

EXPECTED RESULT:
   All 41 tests should pass, showing:
   - HashMap operations working
   - Encryption/decryption working
   - User authentication working
   - Password storage working
   - Multi-user isolation working
